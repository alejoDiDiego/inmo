Hi, this is Inmo. A Zillow like web app to see and sell real state houses and departments.
The page isn't finished but it is mostly functional, if you want to try it yourself run the following commands:
- cd proyecto
- npm i (or npm install)
- npm run dev
  
If you have any trouble or want to contact me, fell free to write to alejoh2014@gmail.com
